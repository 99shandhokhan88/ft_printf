## Introduction

The `ft_printf` project is a comprehensive exercise in implementing a simplified version of the standard C library's `printf` function in C. This guide provides an overview of the project, its purpose, how to get started, and advanced topics for customization and improvement.

## Project Overview

In the `ft_printf` project, you are tasked with creating a function, `ft_printf`, that mimics the behavior of the `printf` function in C. This function allows you to format and print various types of data, such as strings, numbers, and other objects, to the standard output or a file stream.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with the `ft_printf` project, you need the following prerequisites:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or similar).
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ft_printf.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ft_printf
   ```

3. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

### Function Description

The `ft_printf` function mimics the behavior of the standard `printf` function. The function signature is as follows:

```c
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
```

- `format`: A string that specifies the format of the output, including placeholders for values to be inserted.
- Additional arguments: Values to be inserted into the format string based on format specifiers.

The function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null-terminating character).

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `ft_printf` function:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main(void)
{
    char *name = "John";
    int age = 30;

    ft_printf("Hello, my name is %s, and I am %d years old.\n", name, age);

    return 0;
}
```

## Customization

You can customize the `ft_printf` project by adding support for additional format specifiers or modifying the behavior of existing ones. Explore options for formatting and displaying data to meet your specific requirements.

## Advanced Topics

### Format Specifiers

Understand the use of format specifiers in the `ft_printf` function. Customize and extend the list of supported format specifiers to handle various data types and formatting options.

### Memory Management

Efficient memory management is important when dealing with strings and dynamic memory allocation. Explore techniques for managing memory associated with formatted output, such as allocating and freeing memory appropriately.

## Introduction

The `ft_printf` project's bonus challenges provide an opportunity to extend the functionality of your `ft_printf` implementation by adding custom format specifiers, modifiers, and other advanced features. This guide outlines the bonus challenges and provides guidance on how to approach them.

## Project Overview

The `ft_printf` project is an exercise in implementing a simplified version of the standard C library's `printf` function in C. Bonuses involve adding custom features and format specifiers beyond the project's initial requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work on the bonus challenges for the `ft_printf` project, you need the following prerequisites:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or similar).
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git@github.com:99shandhokhan88/ft_printf.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ft_printf
   ```

3. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Bonus Challenges

### Custom Format Specifiers

Consider adding custom format specifiers to support additional data types or formatting options. For example, you can add specifiers for handling dates, binary data, or custom data structures.

### Modifiers

Implement modifiers that modify the behavior of existing format specifiers. For instance, you can support width and precision modifiers for numeric types or alignment modifiers for strings.

### Additional Features

Explore advanced features, such as colored output, positional arguments, or support for internationalization (i18n). These features can enhance the usability and versatility of your `ft_printf` implementation.

## Testing

Ensure that your bonuses are well-tested. Write test cases that cover various scenarios and edge cases to verify the correctness and robustness of your extended `ft_printf` implementation.

## Contributing

Contributions to the `ft_printf` project, including bonuses, are welcome. Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests for new features and format specifiers.
